# RebornMobile

RebornMobile - the first **mobile** client for the Reborn MMoRPG!

RebornMobile runs on **iOS & Android** and enables you to play Reborn on the go.

# How to Play?

Just download the pre-compiled app available on stores and run!

If you would like to compile the client yourself you will need:

- unity with 2019.4.12f1 installed
- android sdk 30+ for android phones and tablets
- latest xcode app installed on your MAC PC, for iPhone and iPad, with iOS 12+
- visual studio 2019 community edition for windows

all the graphic has been stripped from the available package, since icons and internal graphics are NOT useable without prior written permission.
